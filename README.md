# geometry
This repository contains a toy program to search for minimal geometric
constructions using only a compass.

One of the big difficulties with doing so the na√Øve way is that IEEE floating
point arithmetic is inexact, and this makes it difficult to know if two numbers
are, in fact, the same. To solve this I had to first implement a library for
symbolic computation. (Luckily, we don't need to support very many operations
for this, which keeps the complexity from getting too out-of-control.)
